Ada Lovelace, whose notes added to the end of Luigi Menabrea's
paper included the first algorithm designed for processing by an
Analytical Engine. She is often recognized as history's first computer
programmer.

Programmable devices have existed at least as far back as 1206 AD,
when the automata of Al-Jazari were programmable, via pegs and cams,
to play various rhythms and drum patterns;[3] and the 1801 Jacquard
loom could produce entirely different weaves by changing
the "program" - a series of pasteboard cards with holes punched in
them.
However, the first computer program is generally dated to 1843,
when mathematician Ada Lovelace published an algorithm to calculate
a sequence of Bernoulli numbers, intended to be carried out b
Charles Babbage's Analytical Engine.[4] Women would continue to
dominate the field of computer programming until the mid 1960s.
